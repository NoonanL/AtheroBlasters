# AtheroBlasters
Arcade style game written in Python for Glasgow University College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences.

Developed as a free project in support of Glasgow University research in conjunction with the Center for Molecular Nanometrology for use at promotional events to get a new generation of kids interested in STEM. In laymans terms the research involved shooting nano particles at different types of cells within an artery in order to identify them as a means of sooner detecting signs of Heart Disease. 

The game tries to show this by shooting at unknown particles to determine their colour and then the player recieves points for shooting the correct particles with the matching colour of nanoparticle while avoiding shooting the Red Blood Cell character! 

Requirements - designed to run on a portable Raspberry Pi device:
  Python version 2.7 or higher.
  Pygame 1.9.1 or higher.
